🧬 Cancer Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio, showcasing how I apply SQL to oncology research — with a focus on sarcoma, rare cancers, and glioma.
As a medical doctor on the oncology track, I’m transitioning into data analytics to uncover insights that support precision cancer research.

This repository highlights hands-on projects using TCGA datasets to explore mutation patterns and survival trends in rare cancers, contributing to more data-driven oncology research.

⸻

🔍 Key Projects (Week 1)

	•	TCGA Sarcoma Mutation Analysis — Queried TCGA data using Google BigQuery to identify top mutated genes in sarcoma. Applied SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY operations and exported results to CSV for downstream analysis.
	•	Skill Building — Practicing SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN) to analyze clinical and genomic data, building a foundation for bioinformatics and oncology data analysis roles.

⸻

🧠 Skills

	•	SQL: Querying and analyzing TCGA datasets in BigQuery
	•	Tools: Google BigQuery · VS Code · Git · Tableau Public (upcoming)
	•	Domain Expertise: Sarcoma · Rare cancers · Glioma · Precision oncology

⸻

🎯 Goal

To integrate my medical background with data science to generate actionable insights in sarcoma, rare cancers, and glioma — advancing the field of precision oncology.

⸻

📈 Progress

	•	Day 1–2: Completed Mode SQL Beginner tutorials (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)
	•	Day 3–4: Finished Khan Academy SQL Basics and JOINs
	•	Day 5: Queried TCGA sarcoma mutations and uploaded results to GitHub
